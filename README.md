This is my resume 📑 which i have  been created like a website.

There is a html file 📂 which is the main content of my website and it is named as index.html.

Ive added a style.css 📂 file in the public folder 🗂️. Here by using the css I designed my html more attractive.

In the assests folder 🗂️ i stored a lot of images for my resume website.

Also I've added two html files which is in the public folder 🗂️ named as personal.html & contact.html . These two files 📂 are linked to my index.html file in which ive included my personal & contact details.

THANK YOU 😇!
