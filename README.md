This is my resume which i have  been created like a website
There is a html file which is the main content of my website and it is named as index.html
Ive added a style.css file in the public folder. Here by using the css I designed my html more attractive.
In the assests folder i stored a lot of images for my resume website.
Also I've added two html files which is in the public folder named as personal.html & contact.html . These two files are linked to my index.html file in which ive included my personal & contact details.
